# Bootstrap
Learning the basics of Bootstrap and the different elements e.g jumbotron, cards.

Bootstrap comes with a number of preset color values for its elements that can come in handy: primary, success, info, warning, and danger.

Rows must be placed inside of a container. 
Rows act as wrappers for columns, and columns must be be located inside of a row.

Bootstrap's grid system allows up to 12 columns across the page.
If a column exceeds 12, it will form a new column below.
